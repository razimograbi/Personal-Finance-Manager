              Welcome to Budget Buddy, crafted with passion by three dedicated
              students from Braude Academic College! As final-year students, we
              recognized the need for a comprehensive Personal Finance Manager
              to empower individuals in taking control of their financial
              journey. With a commitment to simplifying financial management, we
              have designed Budget Buddy to be your trusted companion in
              navigating the complexities of personal finances. Our
              user-friendly platform offers robust features such as budget
              tracking, expense categorization, and financial goal setting,
              providing you with the tools you need to make informed financial
              decisions. At Budget Buddy, we believe that financial well-being
              should be accessible to everyone, and we are excited to embark on
              this journey with you towards a more secure and prosperous future.
              Join us as we empower individuals to achieve their financial
              goals, one budget at a time!
